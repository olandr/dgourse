List of qualifications for specific requirements

The list of qualifications for specific requirements should be divided in three sections under the headings:

\xc2\xa0Life science
\xc2\xa0Chemistry
\xc2\xa0Mathematics and Numerical Analysis/Computer Science

The student should list all courses from previous studies that qualify under the different headings. The student needs to convert the local credits system to ECTS credits for each course. One full academic year of studies is equal to 60 ECTS credits. The ECTS total under each heading should be calculated and have to reach 20 ECTS credits for Life science, 30 ECTS credits for Chemistry and 20 ECTS credits for Mathematics and Numerical Analysis/Computer Science (see the specific requirements section for additional details).
All courses in the three fields taken previously should be listed under the headings. On-going relevant courses could also be listed, but they have to be clearly marked as not concluded.
